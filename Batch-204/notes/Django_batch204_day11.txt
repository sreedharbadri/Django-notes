# Template Inheritance

1) We are trying to integrate the bootstrap with our django project.

Reference:
http://getbootstrap.com/

2) in the link given below hit on the download button to download the bootstrap-4.0.0-beta-dist.zip.
3) In my case the zip got downloaded in the Downloads section.
4) Later copy it to the src/project_local location.

khyaathi@khyaathi-Technologies:~/Downloads$ cp bootstrap-4.0.0-beta-dist.zip ~khyaathi/Documents/tuxfux-hlp-notes/Django-notes/Batch-204/src/project_local/

khyaathi@khyaathi-Technologies:~/Downloads$ cd ~khyaathi/Documents/tuxfux-hlp-notes/Django-notes/Batch-204/src/project_local/

5) unzip the bootstrap-4.0.0-beta-dist.zip
# unzip bootstrap-4.0.0-beta-dist.zip

your project_local should have following directories

project_locals
- css
- js
base.css

6) Now lets try to select a template.

http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/
http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/

7) right click on the blog template to get the code.

So lets create some templates under our src/templates locations.

* create a base.html file which will be common for all the other tempalates.
* create a home.html and extend the base.html into the home.html pages.
* from the base.html take out chunks of code and put them in bootstrap folder.
* files inside your bootstrap folder - footer.html,head.html,navbar.html,sidebar.html
* include those into the base.html

8) Incorporate the base.html into the other templates also - src/blog/templates
* the templates are blog_data.html,blog_form.html,contact_form.html,thankyou.html

9) Pleae view the followign location for change in the urls and views.
* src/blog/forms.py,src/blog/urls.py,src/blog/views.py,src/blog/
* src/myapps/urls.py
